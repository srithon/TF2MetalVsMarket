# TF2MetalVsMarket
A descendant of my other project: [link](https://github.com/srithon/GameTameDealFinder "GameTameDealFinder")  
This project works by scraping metal prices off of Backpack.tf and storing items in a database in order to compare their "metal" (economy) prices with their Steam Market prices.  
After the last one failed, this project was intended to find discrepancies between the TF2 community economy and the Steam Market prices.  
This also ended up failing because the two are intrinsically connected.
